<h1>CALCTEST fun</h1>

For this exercise, I am using Create React App (reactjs and jest)



In the project directory, calctest/app/ you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the dev mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.




Recommended using Chrome - works and tested in Firefox and Safari.
